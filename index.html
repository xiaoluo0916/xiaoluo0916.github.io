        <h2>Research on Crimes in Chicago</h2>
        <h3>Scene 1: Overview of crime trend</h3>
        <div class="bg">
            <p class="mt-10">
                The dataset includes the reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders 
                where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2010 to present.
                The data comes from Data Fulfillment and Analysis Division of the Chicago Police Department 
                at DFA@ChicagoPolice.org. 

                In the first scene, let's plot the number of crimes over time and observe the crime trend. 
            </p>
            <p class="mt-10">
            Observations:
                <ul class="mt-10">- From 2010 to 2014, on average, there were less than 100 reported incidents
                    of crime per day in Chicago. 
                </ul>
                <ul class="mt-10">- However, from 2015 to 2017, the reported crimes surged to 500+ hundreds
                    per day, which caused severe security concerns of citizens. 
                </ul>
                <ul class="mt-10">- From 2018 to 2022, the reported crimes went back to less than 100 per day again.
                </ul>
                <ul class="mt-10">- Starting from the beginning of 2023, the reported crimes surged again and there
                    have been over 600 incidents of crimes per day.
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mt-10">
                The follow up question from this chart is, can we dig more into the peak between 2015 and 2018 and understand 
                what types of crimes there were?

                Let's explore in the second scene.
