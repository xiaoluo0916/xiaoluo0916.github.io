        <h2>Research on Crimes in Chicago</h2>
        <h3>Scene 3: Break down by crime type, and whether the criminals were arrested</h3>
        <div class="bg">
            <p class="mt-10">
                Previoulsy, we saw that the incidents of top 10 crime types are quite significant.

                In the third scene, let's further break down the crime count by primary type as well as whether the 
                criminals were arrested to understand if the local authority was effective in arresting criminals. 
            </p>
            <p class="mt-10">
            Observations:
                <ul class="mt-10">- Within the top  10 prevalent crime types, narcotics has almost 100% arrest ratio, 
                    which is good to know. Battery, other offense and assault have around 20% arrest ratio. The other 
                    prevalent criminal types have less than 10% arrest ratio, which is not ideal. 
                </ul>
                <ul class="mt-10">- Some crime types are more severe than the others in terms of the impact, such as narcotics, 
                     assault, criminal trespass, weapons violation, offense involving children, crime sexual assault, kidnapping,
                     homicide, human trafficking. Only narcotics, criminal trespass, weapons violation have over 60% arrest ratio. 
                     Others have low arrest ratio, which is not ideal. 
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mt-10">
                As of now, you may wonder how each crime type trends over time. In the next scene, you will have more 
                flexibility to filter this chart on crime types.
