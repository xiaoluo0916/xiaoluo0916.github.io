        <h2>Research on Crimes in Chicago</h2>
        <h3>Scene 2: Break down by crime type</h3>
        <div class="bg">
            <p class="mt-10">
                Previoulsy, we saw that the incidents of crimes are significant, especially during 2015 and 2017, 
                and after 2023. 

                In the second scene, let's break down the crime count by primary type to understand what types of 
                crimes were prevalent in Chicago. 
            </p>

        <p class="mt-10">
            x axis: crime type <br>
            y axis: number of crime count
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="chart2"></div>
    <div class="bg">
        <p class="mt-10">
            Observations:
                <ul class="mt-10">- The top  10 prevalent crime types are: Theft, battery, criminal damage, deceptive
                    practice, assault, other offense, narcotics, motor vehicle theft, burglary, robbery. These 10 crime
                    types contribute to 92% of the overall crimes.
                </ul>
                <ul class="mt-10">- There have been over 200,000 incidents of theft, over 100,000 incidents of battery, 
                    and over 100,000 incidents of crimial damage since 2010, which is quite shocking.
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mt-10">
                The follow up question from this chart is, has the local authority been helpful in arresting the criminals?
                In order to understand that, we can split up this bar chart by arrest vs unarrest. 

                Let's explore in the third scene.
